        <h1>Dashrath Manjhi - The Mountain Man</h1>
        <p>
            Dashrath Manjhi's enduring spirit transformed not just a mountain, but the futures of countless villagers in Gehlaur, Bihar. Here's an exploration of his life and journey:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Born in a poor family in 1934, Manjhi worked in the fields as a laborer and lived in the remote village of Gehlaur in Bihar, India.</li>
            <li>His journey began in tragedy when his wife, Falguni Devi, slipped and injured herself while crossing the Gehlour hills. The nearest medical center was 55 km away due to the mountain that blocked the direct route.</li>
            <li>Distraught and driven by the desire to prevent any more suffering due to the mountain, Manjhi decided to carve a path through it.</li>
            <li>Locals initially mocked him, considering the task impossible. But Manjhi was undeterred. He sold his goats to buy a hammer and chisel.</li>
            <li>Every day, after finishing his work, he would chip away at the mountain. Days turned into years, and finally, after 22 relentless years, in 1982, his path was complete.</li>
            <li>This path made transportation for locals significantly easier, especially for medical emergencies, education, and daily needs.</li>
            <li>Though Manjhi never received formal recognition from the government during his lifetime, his village and countless people remember him as a hero. He passed away in 2007 and was given a state funeral by the Bihar government.</li>
            <li>A statue was erected in his memory, and the Bihar government also proposed a roadway to be named after him.</li>
            <li>Manjhi's incredible story of persistence was popularized globally through the 2015 Bollywood film "Manjhi â€“ The Mountain Man" starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui.</li>
            <li>Today, he stands as a symbol of perseverance, teaching us that no challenge is too vast if one has determination and unwavering belief.</li>
        </ul>
